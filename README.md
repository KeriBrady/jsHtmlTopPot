# jsHtmlTopPot

Select your Top Pot store location from the drop down menu, and then click the submit button (this is the user input). The app will list the name of your selected location, and under that header it will list the hourly donut production forecast as well as the total donuts needed per day in bolded text (this is the output).

To select another location, click the refresh button then select another location and click submit. The next chosen location's content will flow into the div element.
